# **JakobLiTe**

I'm a student interested in programming, mainly small web-based projects.  
Most of what I work on involves JavaScript, simple game mechanics, and experimenting with how far the browser can be pushed without any frameworks.

I use GitHub to keep track of personal projects, school assignments, and whatever I build while learning.

## **What I’m Working On**
- Small HTML/JS games  
- Experiments with canvas rendering  
- Basic 2D/3D projection techniques  
- Improving workflow with VS Code and Git  
- Building cleaner and more readable code over time  

---

## **Selected Projects**
**Flying Game (pseudo-3D canvas experiment)**  
Small browser game using simple projection math, obstacles, movement, and basic UI.  
*(See repositories for details.)*

**Jakten**  
Grid-based movement game with basic enemy logic and scoring.
